# Java - Object Oriented Programming

## Dependencies

Refer to the following markdown file for the respective sections of the class:
- [Self Studies](./studies.md)
- [Lesson](./lesson.md)
- [Assignment](./assignment.md)

## Lesson Objectives

Learners will understand:
- What is OOP and its use cases.
- The concept of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction. 

Learners will be able to:
- Implement encapsulation with `private` modifiers and accessor methods.
- Implement inheritance with `protected` modifiers where protected members are accessible by child class.
- Implement polymorphism using method overloading.
- Implement abstraction with `interfaces` and `abstract method`.

|- 5mins |Start zoom session|So that students can join early and start class on time|
|15 mins|Self studies check-in|Does every students have JDK installed? Are there any questions on self-studies? If the students do not have SDK installed, they can practice in class using w3schools links provided in the self studies.|
|15 mins|I DO Part 1|Instructor demonstrates encapsulation and inheritance|
|15 mins|WE DO Part 1|Learners implements encapsulation and inheritance|
|15 mins|I DO Part 2|Instructors demonstrate polymorphism through method overloading|
|15 mins|WE DO Part 2|Learners create methods using method overloading|
|5 mins| Break||
|||**1 HR 20 MIN**|
